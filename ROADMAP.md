# Curated Contracts — Roadmap

Foundry-native, Solidity-tested reference implementations of ERCs with strong community traction.

## Per-ERC Workflow

1. Interface definition (IERC*.sol)
2. Non-upgradeable implementation
3. Upgradeable implementation (ERC7201 namespaced storage + Initializable)
4. Full test suite (unit + fuzz)
5. Internal security audit
6. Documentation (NatSpec)
